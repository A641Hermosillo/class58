        <p>For a long time, drawing has been considered to be a thing for just a few people who are talented and passionate about it.
            However, there is more to drawing than just marking images on a piece of paper. Drawing is a way of thinking in itself. It is a way one can express their emotions and bring meaning to moments in their lives. Drawing can help you visualize the various components that make the world around you.
            To bring out that perfect image, one needs to be focused and block any form of distractions.</p>
